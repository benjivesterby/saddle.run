The Saddle Run Community is made up of approximately 130 homes. Each home enjoys
a spacious lot on a quiet street. You will notice neighbors out walking, working
in the yard and talking.

Our community is located just 5 minutes from Fuquay Varina and Holly Springs in
either direction, and only 10 minutes from Cary - so getting to shopping and
near-by activities is very close and easy to access.

There are a lot of great things about the Saddle Run community that you will be
able to enjoy when you live here.  Each of the lots in Saddle Run are from .5
acres and up in size. This ensures that you will have plenty of space to enjoy
living here.

The community pool is open seasonally and provides a place of relaxation and
acts as a meeting place during the warm and hot months of spring and summer.
Between the community pool and stables is placed a community park.
Community-wide events are hosted here as well as everyday use of the playground
and grassy area - for kids and adults alike to enjoy.

Saddle Run is fortunate to have been established as an equine community. The
community stables help to maintain that "out in the country" feel of the
community while providing views of horses galloping in the pastures as you
walk/play in the community park.

Early in the morning, throughout the day and in the evening time - no matter
what the time, you will notice many neighbors take advantage of the "walker
friendly" roads that pass through our Saddle Run community.

Saddle Run is an established community that has been in place for over 20 years
with a good mix of all types of individuals and families.
