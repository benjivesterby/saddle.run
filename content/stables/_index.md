## An Equestrian Community

Saddle Run is unique in the fact that we have a community barn, making us an
Equestrian Community! The barn is a wonderful community asset! if you are
interested in knowing more about horses, our barn, and the current horses we
have at the barn, feel free to stop by. Most of the horses LOVE the attention
and enjoy apples & carrots as treats! We ask that you not enter the pastures
without a horse owner present, as horses are big animals and sometimes become
"spooked" and will take off running in an instant, without much regard to what
might be in their way!
