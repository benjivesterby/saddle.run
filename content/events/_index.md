## HOA Meetings

The Saddle Run Homeowner's Association (HOA) Meetings will typically be held on
the 1st Wednesday of each month, subject to change as needed.  Please check back
often for the location and specific date of the meeting.  Homeowner's are
encouraged to attend each meeting. "Homeowner Time" is available to allow any
resident to bring up any issues, provide feedback on a topic or ask questions.

HOA Meetings will be held at the Pool for the 2023 summer season.
