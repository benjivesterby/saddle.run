Each home enjoys a spacious lot on a quiet street. You will notice neighbors out walking, working in the yard and talking.
Our community is located just 5 minutes from Fuquay Varina and Holly Springs in either direction, and only 10 minutes from Cary - so getting to shopping and near-by activities is very close and easy to access.</description></item></channel></rss>
